# Robo-Stream

Robo-Stream is an OBS WebSocket Client.  It started off as a port of the Stream-Pi Server and Stream-Pi Client from Java to Go using nothing but Claude AI.  As it progressed I realized this product was no longer limited to Raspberry Pi touchscreens and that in the future I wanted it to run on IOS and Android tablets.

All code as of December 31, 2026 was written by Claude AI through a 2 week long collaboration.
